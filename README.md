# LangChain-Tutorials


Each Notebook illustrate of how Langchain work through OPenAi and Hugging face



## 1 - [Build First Hugging Face](https://github.com/MAHMOUDRR707/LangChain-Tutorials/blob/master/01-Build_your_first_LLM.ipynb)

First tutriol INtroducing you to llm and openAi and how to call your LLM from each openAi and Hugging Face

 ----

## 2 - [LLM Template](https://github.com/MAHMOUDRR707/LangChain-Tutorials/blob/master/02_LLM_Templates.ipynb)

In this Notebook we start to show what is prompt and how it works and How should we pass it to LLM model with multiply inputs

----

## 3 - [LLM Schema](https://github.com/MAHMOUDRR707/LangChain-Tutorials/blob/master/03_LLM_Schemes_Chat.ipynb)

In this Notebook we start to  Build conversation with ChatGpt chat and build dialog for chatbot


----

## 4 - [Few Shot Learning](https://github.com/MAHMOUDRR707/LangChain-Tutorials/blob/master/04_Few_shot_learning.ipynb)

In this Notebook we start to explain one of technquies which help our chat model to understand some tricks or equation which it would understand

----

## 5 - [Output Parser](https://github.com/MAHMOUDRR707/LangChain-Tutorials/blob/master/05_output_Parser.ipynb)

In this Notebook we start to explain different formats of chat outut and how we could control it

----


## 6 - [Memory](https://github.com/MAHMOUDRR707/LangChain-Tutorials/blob/master/06_llm_chat_memory.ipynb)

In this Notebook we start to explain one of technquies which help our chat model to understand previous message to answer correctly  by using different types of memory (buffer , buffer window , Enitty .. )

----


## 7 - [RAG-Chunking and Loader](https://github.com/MAHMOUDRR707/LangChain-Tutorials/blob/master/07_RAG_Loader_with_Chunking.ipynb)

In this Notebook we start to  display different types of loader in langchain and how we could make chunks through different mehtods

----

## 8 - [RAG-Embedding and Indexing](https://github.com/MAHMOUDRR707/LangChain-Tutorials/blob/master/08_RAG_Embedding_and_Indexing.ipynb)

In this Notebook we start to  display different types of Embedding in langchain and how we could build vector database with different ways and indexing chuncks with its embedding

----

## 9 - [RAG-QNA Chain](https://github.com/MAHMOUDRR707/LangChain-Tutorials/blob/master/09_RAG_QNA_Chain.ipynb)

In this Notebook we start to  display different types of Qna (suff, map reduce , refine) in langchain and how we could build the whole rag
